# CFBD - Customize Folders By Default !

CFBD is an abandoned project that allowed to modify the default directory of Music, Pictures, Documents, Videos, Desktop and Downloads libraries on Linux, and easily, as on Windows.

I did it to learn Python, it's been a while since I've touched it, use it at your own risk !
To launch CFBD, equip yourself with Python 3 and make these commands:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Fokushy/CFBD.git
$ cd CFBD
$ sudo python3 CFBD.py
```
This will modify your "/etc/fstab" file, so **be careful**.
